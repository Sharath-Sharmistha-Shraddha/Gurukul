We have used Firebase for a realtime database access and used Android Studio to develop our app.
The custom_toolbar file provides the code for a toolbar which we thought was more apt for our app.
There are multiple bg files in drawable folder for background of multiple items.
The highlight file makes a item highlighted when it is selected.
The main purpose of our app is to provide a learning path for people seeking to try out new things.
